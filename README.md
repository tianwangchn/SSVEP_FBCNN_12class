# SSVEP_FBCNN_12class
This project is for the 12-class SSVEP classification based on FBCNN

The dataset is available: https://github.com/mnakanishi/12JFPM_SSVEP/tree/master/data

requirment:
  python >= 3.6  
  tensorflow >= 2.0.0  
  scipy >= 1.4.1  
  scikit-learn >= 0.22.2  
  numpy >= 1.16.4  
  
It is recommended to use a GPU to acquire the better performance
